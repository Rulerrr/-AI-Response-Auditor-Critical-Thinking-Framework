# Logic Auditor: A Methodology for Conscientious AI Assessment

Developed by **Ruslan Krucheniuk** | Málaga, Spain | 2026

## Philosophy: Why we audit
Current SaaS LLMs are commercially engineered to prioritise "manic enthusiasm" and user satisfaction over logical truth. Because of the nature of SaaS LLMs' reward systems, these models act as sophisticated pleasers, often falling into the **Sycophancy Trap** to keep retention metrics high.

**This is not just a tool; it is a methodology for the Conscientious Auditor.** An audit is a conscious human act. If it’s not deliberate and critical, it’s not an audit—it’s just a "check".

## The Core: The Human Logic Handbook
The heart of this project is the **[Handbook of Sophisms and Paradoxes](./Sofizm-eng.html)**. It serves as a logical baseline independent of AI hallucinations. 

Before you trust the "vibe" of an answer, use this handbook to identify:
* **Systemic Paradoxes:** (Braess, Goodhart, Jevons) to see how the solution might break the system.
* **Logical Fallacies:** (Post Hoc, Circular Reasoning, Base Rate Fallacy) to dismantle the "illusion of logic".
* **Semantic Leakage:** To catch when cultural tropes replace evidence-based reasoning.

## The Workflow: Augmenting Human Agency
We do not delegate the responsibility for truth to the machine. We use the **[PROMPT.md](./PROMPT.md)** only to *augment* our own auditing process.

1. **Observe:** Identify the "manic enthusiasm" or "safe" diplomatic answer in the LLM output.
2. **Challenge:** Apply the Auditor Directive to force the model into an "intellectually brutal" state.
3. **Verify:** Use the Human Logic Handbook to judge if the revised response has moved from "satisfying" to "logically sound".

## ⚠️ Professional Warning
A system designed to guess intent and provide satisfaction is fundamentally incapable of self-detecting its own hallucinations. If you are not conducting a **conscientious audit**, you are merely a non-critical consumer of high-tech illusions.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
Special thanks to **Michael Bolton** for the intellectual "stress-test" of this framework. 
Our discussion was pivotal in refining this methodology from a simple "manual" prompt into a **Conscientious Audit** process. Michael's insights on the "manic enthusiasm" of commercial models and the inherent biases of the Saas LLMs' reward systems helped shape the final version of this handbook.
The "Recursive Experiment" challenged here proved that an LLM cannot be its own judge—only deliberate human agency can provide a true audit path.
